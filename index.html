                                                I am from Dhaka, Bangladesh; a first-year Ph.D. student in Computer Science under the guidance of

                                                and exploring the Trustworthiness of Artificial Intelligence, including the Privacy, Safety and Security, with a specific emphasis on Large Language Models like ChatGPT. Other research interests include
                                                Computer Vision, Cloud Computing, Modeling & Simulation and Human-Computer Interaction.

                                                At present, as a dedicated researcher, I am actively engaged in exploring different projects that allow me to delve deeper into the areas that captivate my interest. I have co-authored several conference papers and presented my research papers in different
                                                well-reputed conferences. My researches have been published in premier journal of cloud computing (IEEE TCC) and conference (COMPASS). In addition to doing research, I have the experience of actively participating
                                                as a reviewer in the peer-review process of research papers at different confernce (NeurIPS, ICLR) and journal (ACM JCSS). Also, I have been honored with several research awards covering participation grants,
                                                travel grants, etc. Outside of my academic interests, I love to play games, watch TV Shows and anime. I love immersing myself in the virtual worlds of my favorite video games and challenging my friends to
                                                epic battles. I am also a big fan of outdoor activities and try to go cycling whenever I get the chance.

                                                <!-- Meet Joyanta, the ultimate multitasker (when he's not procrastinating, that is)! When he's not busy procrastinating and finding new ways to avoid his responsibilities, you may find him randomly
                                                thinking on how to solve the impossible equation of life, to get the meaning out of it. He is a late sleeping utopian that spends his free time harassing neighbors with his late-night screamings, while playing
                                                online video games. If you have the ill-fate to live on the next-door to his, you may hear him to scream with enthusiastic battle cries like "মার মার!" (Crush them!) in his gaming sessions, in the midnight
                                                when owls should have been hooting instead. While some say he was “born under a struggling sign” or considers him as an enigma or an absolutely useless as a person, he chooses to believe that he is a higher
                                                level Buddha of sorts with great plans and designs on the founding of his empire in the Bengal Region. Also, in an epic twist of fate, he is connected to an extraordinary academic lineage; to legends like
                                                Issac Newton, De Morgan, Thomson, and Rutherford, explaining his unparalleled prowess (though in a way that may leave such great minds scratching their heads, wondering how their legacy ended up with him).
                                                Again, some mention him as a superhero since he stays inactive or randomly gets out of touch in social media messaging even though he is found really proactive sharing memes. Catch him on the gaming world,
                                                where he is known by his in-game name "LePotatoGuy" or "Potato" 🥔, in short which resembles both his physical size and gameplay style. If you want to challenge (and inevitably defeat) him to a game, don't
                                                hesitate to give Joyanta a shout! -->
                                                Meet Joyanta, the ultimate multitasker (or so he likes to believe) when he's not deep into his profession of being "Professionally Clueless". When he's not neck-deep in procrastination or, let's be real, wallowing in existential dread, he's playing Sherlock
                                                with life's most enigmatic equations. A proud nocturnal utopian, Joyanta's hobbies include serenading his neighbors with banshee-like gaming screams during unholy hours. If your luck's taken a nosedive,
                                                you might just be that unfortunate soul living next door, woken up by his dramatic cries of "মার মার!" (Crush them!) - a sound that even the owls find, well, a tad much. There are legends that speak of Joyanta
                                                being "born under the 'What-the-heck?' star", and while some might consider him a beautiful mess of contradictions, Joyanta self-identifies as a sort of deluxe edition Buddha, primed to build his 'not-so-grand'
                                                empire in Bengal. Hilariously enough, he's supposedly linked to an academic lineage that includes icons like Issac Newton and Rutherford. Yes, you heard that right. How they feel about this mysterious connection
                                                is yet to be determined, but we can bet they're ... perplexed. For someone who could easily bag the "Most Likely to Ghost You" award on social media, Joyanta's meme game is surprisingly on point. Find this
                                                gentle soul, often mashing buttons under the moniker "LePotatoGuy" or just "Potato" 🥔 for short – a title that gloriously mirrors his physique and, um, impressive gaming skills. Fancy a match where you
                                                can most certainly claim an easy win? Give Joyanta a shout – if he’s not too busy being professionally clueless, that is!
