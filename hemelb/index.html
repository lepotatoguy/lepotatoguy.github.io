    <h1>HemeLB Tutorial</h1>
    <h2>
      Software for high performance parallel lattice-Boltzmann simulations for
      large scale fluid flow in vascular geometries
    </h2>
    <p>
      HemeLB is a high performance lattice-Boltzmann solver optimized for
      simulating blood flow through sparse geometries, such as those found in
      the human vasculature. It is routinely deployed on powerful
      supercomputers, scaling to hundreds of thousands of cores even for complex
      geometries . HemeLB has traditionally been used to model cerebral
      bloodflow and vascular remodelling in retinas , but is now being applied
      to simulating the fully coupled human arterial and venous trees. This work
      forms part of the fast growing field of Computational Biomedicine.
      Physiology and medicine are being revolutionised by the growing role of
      information technology. Our ability to acquire and manage data on both
      animals and humans allows us to develop increasingly detailed
      computational models of the biological processes sustaining life. These
      models, together with the relevant experimental data, are helping
      researchers to gain insight into the physiology and pathology of the
      systems under study, in many cases beyond what is possible with purely
      observational methods.

      The work has been primarily done from the research lab of Prof. Peter V
      Coveney from University College London.
